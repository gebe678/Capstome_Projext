# Maria's Diary

## Feb. 19 2021

1. Skimmed Victor's Zhou [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) 
2. Started reading the first chapter of the *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction* book we found online
3. Found a cool [website](https://www.datacamp.com) that has Deep Learning courses that seem very interesting

**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. Figure out if I actually need all the math included in Victor's post and rereadit more in-depth  
2. Finish Chapter 1 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*
3. Look into the courses offered in Datacamp and pick one to practice 

## Feb. 21 2021
1. Read [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) thoroughly. He mentions experimenting with ML libraries such as Keras and Datacamp has a course in this
2.Read through the descriptions of the Deep Learning courses I found and decided to get staarted with *Introduction to Deep Learning in Python*
3. Finished Chapter 1 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*

**Things I need to learn more about based on today's reading**
1. Partial derivates and derivatives in general
2. Chain rule as it seems to be very important for training the model to have a lower loss
3. Gradient Descent (maybe?)
4. Taylor series? 

**To-Do For Next Time**

1. Continue with the Datacamp course
2. Get started on Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*
3. Find a good calc crash course 
4. Watch the 3Blue1Brown videos

## Feb. 24-25 2021
1. I watched 2.5 videos from the 3Blue1Brown channel on Neural Networks. I now have a better understanding of them since the book does not have many images
2. Started Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction* but I will need to continue reading later today 

**To-Do For Next Time (ideally tonight)**
1. Finish Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*
2. Finish watching the 3Blue1Brown videos 
3. Get started learning calculus 
4. Continue with the course and make sure to save my progress this time!
