# Maria's Diary

## Feb. 19 2021

1. Skimmed Victor's Zhou [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) 
2. Started reading the first chapter of the *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction* book we found online
3. Found a cool [website](https://www.datacamp.com) that has Deep Learning courses that seem very interesting

**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. Figure out if I actually need all the math included in Victor's post and rereadit more in-depth  
2. Finish Chapter 1 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*
3. Look into the courses offered in Datacamp and pick one to practice 

## Feb. 21 2021
1. Read [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) thoroughly. He mentions experimenting with ML libraries such as Keras and Datacamp has a course in this
2.Read through the descriptions of the Deep Learning courses I found and decided to get staarted with *Introduction to Deep Learning in Python*
3. Finished Chapter 1 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*

**Things I need to learn more about based on today's reading**
1. Partial derivates and derivatives in general
2. Chain rule as it seems to be very important for training the model to have a lower loss
3. Gradient Descent (maybe?)
4. Taylor series? 

**To-Do For Next Time**

1. Continue with the Datacamp course
2. Get started on Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*
3. Find a good calc crash course 
4. Watch the 3Blue1Brown videos

## Feb. 24-25 2021
1. I watched 2.5 videos from the 3Blue1Brown channel on Neural Networks. I now have a better understanding of them since the book does not have many images
2. Started Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction* but I will need to continue reading later today 

**To-Do For Next Time (ideally tonight)**
1. Finish Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*
2. Finish watching the 3Blue1Brown videos 
3. Get started learning calculus 
4. Continue with the course and make sure to save my progress this time! 

## Feb. 25 2021
1. I finished watching the videos from the 3Blue1Brown channel on Neural Networks 

**Notes about today**
The calculus behind backpropagation seems doable but is still very confusing without a background on calculus

**To-Do For Next Time**
1. Check out the resources mentioned in his videos about linear algebra and calculus and see if they are helpful 
2. Ask around and see if these math concepts are a must in order to work with neural networks at the level we want to and in the time we have left
3. Check out the code that the guy from 3Blue1Brown mentioned in his second video

## March 1 2021
1. I finished  reading Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*, turns out discrete math is very important, glad I payed attention in the class
2. I'm Halfway done with the Datacamp course *Introduction to Deep Learning in Python* (2 more hours to go according to their time estimate)

**Notes and questions about today**
1. I'm really enjoying the Datacamp course. The course reminds me a lot about the videos from 3Blue1Brown but I enjoy the questions that they give after every video and the coding practice that you have for each concept 
2. Do I need to research more about threshold logic?
3. "Usually the integration function g is the addition function" I think this refers to the sum() function I've been using in the Datacamp course code 
4. Seeing some integrals? derivatives? in 2.5.1, I foresee some nightmares in the next weeks

**To-Do For Next Time**
1. Do at least 1 hour of the Datacamp course
2. Start watching math videos and brush up on algebra and precalc before attempting to learn calculus

## March 3 2021
1. I'm now 75% done with the *Introduction to Deep Learning in Python*, I have been spending more time on this that their predicted time since I'm taking notes and researching the functions and libraries that I've seen in the practice code 
2. Started reading *Neural Networks and Deep Learning* by Michael Nielsen, the section on Perceptrons looks very similar to Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction* but I prefer this explanation as it is clearer and uses the logic gates that we worked with in MAT 310. 

**To-Do For Next Time**
1. Finish the Datacamp course 
2. Start working through the code provided in Nielsen's book
3. Start reading about Sigmoid neurons on *Neural Networks and Deep Learning*
