# Griffins Diary

1. I began looking into the first two chapters of [Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction](https://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rojas/neural/) on the biological paradigm and threshold logic. These chpaters covered why nueral networks are designed the way they are with the biological inspiration and an introduction to the types of units that are computed to build the nueral networks.

2. I also began watching the video series on nueral netowrks by three blue one brown. They provided a very conceptual overview on what nueral networks are and how they work.

**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. I plan on reading more in-depth on chapter 2 of [Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction](https://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rojas/neural/) and attempt do finish some of the exercises that are listed at the end of the chapter. I also plan on beginning to skim through chpater 3 to get an overview on the next topic: weighted Networks the perceptron.

1. I began looking into some of the higher math concepts needed to better understand nueral networks. This includes partial derivatives and how to take derivatives in 3d space.

2. I also began reviewing some of the matrix math concepts and applied discrete concepts described in chapter 2 of the [Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction](https://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/rojas/neural/) book to make sure that the math makes sense.

3. I have skimmed through chapter 3 of our textbook to get a cursory understanding on what how networks use weights to help decide which functions to use. 

**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. I plan on reading chapter 3 in depth and understanding more of the concepts described.

2. I also plan on looking into the code described in the 2nd three blue one brown video to look at their number reconization network
