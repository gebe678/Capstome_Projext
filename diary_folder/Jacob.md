# Jacob's Diary

## Feb. 17 2021

1. Took my first look at [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) by Victor Zhou
2. I Also began reading Chapter 1 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*. 

**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. I would like to begin reading Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks*
2. I also want to begin looking over math concepts needed for machine learning algorithms. *Mathematics for Machine Learning* should be a good starting place.


## Feb. 22 2021

1. I finished reading over Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks*. The first half of the material involved a lot of boolean functions and introduced the Mcculloch Pitts neural net model. 
2. I also started looking over math for machine learning. I plan on looking over some extra resources to learn some of the multivariable calculus and linear algebra involved. The book assumes a good understanding of some of these topics so it might be useful to watch some videos on them.
3. Finally, I started watching the **3Blue1Brown** series on Neural Networks. After watching both the first and second videos, I think I will take a look at the book that goes alongside the series to help supplement my learning of concepts such as gradient descent and backpropagation. These two concepts seem to hold a lot of weight in the world of neural networks.

**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. Watch episode 3 of 3Blue1Brown and do supplemental reading
2. Read chapter 3 of *Neural Networks*
3. Sharpen up on math before going deeper into the *Mathematics for Machine Learning* book.


## Feb. 23 2021

1. I Looked over Chapter 3 of *Neural Networks*. This chapter introduced the idea of perceptron learning.
2. I finished looking at [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/)


**To-Do For Next Time:** 

1. Watch 3Blue1Brown Episode 3
2. Continue reading the Ebook material found in 3Blue1Brown's neural net series that will help in coding a basic neural network.


## Feb. 25 2021 

1. I finished watching the 3rd episode of 3Blue1Brown's series on neural networks. This video introduces the backpropagation algorithm for deep learning.
2. I also read the supplemental Ebook material 3Blue1Brown included in the description of the video series. 


**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. Watch 3Blue1Brown Episode 4 and finish ebook material relevant to backpropagation.
2. Look over deep learning video series that will help in understanding the concepts in *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*. Found one series that roughly follows the outline of the book.


## Feb. 27 2021 

1. I finished watching the last episode of 3Blue1Brown's neural net series. This video introduced some of the calculus required for backpropagation.
2. I also began looking over a Deep Learning video course that follows the outline of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*. This video condenses a lot of the information into more manageable chunks that are applicable to our project and vision for how we want to make the neural net.


**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. Review some of the calculus concepts brought up in 3Blue1Brown's video series.
2. Finish Ebook reading and continue watching some of the deep learning videos


## Mar. 1 2021

1. I looked over some calculus concepts such as gradients, partial derivatives, and multivariable functions to better understand the background of gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms. My Calculus III textbook helped quite a bit.
2. Finished the Ebook supplemental reading for 3Blue1Brown's series and continued watching some of the deep learning videos up until the perceptron learning video.


**To-Do For Next Time:**
1. Continue reading Chapter 4 of the *Neural Networks* book and watch supplemental videos from the deep learning series.
