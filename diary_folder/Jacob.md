1. Took my first look at [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) by Victor Zhou
2. I Also began reading Chapter 1 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*. 

**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. I would like to begin reading Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks*
2. I also want to begin looking over math concepts needed for machine learning algorithms. *Mathematics for Machine Learning* should be a good starting place.
