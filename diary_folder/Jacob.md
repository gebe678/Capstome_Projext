## Feb. 17 2021

1. Took my first look at [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) by Victor Zhou
2. I Also began reading Chapter 1 of *Neural Networks- A Systematic Introduction*. 

**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. I would like to begin reading Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks*
2. I also want to begin looking over math concepts needed for machine learning algorithms. *Mathematics for Machine Learning* should be a good starting place.

1. I finished reading over Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks*. The first half of the material involved a lot of boolean functions and introduced the Mcculloch Pitts neural net model. 
2. I also started looking over math for machine learning. I plan on looking over some extra resources to learn some of the multivariable calculus and linear algebra involved. The book assumes a good understanding of some of these topics so it might be useful to watch some videos on them.
3. Finally, I started watching the **3Blue1Brown** series on Neural Networks. After watching both the first and second videos, I think I will take a look at the book that goes alongside the series to help supplement my learning of concepts such as gradient descent and backpropagation. These two concepts seem to hold a lot of weight in the world of neural networks.

**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. Watch episode 3 of 3Blue1Brown and do supplemental reading
2. Read chapter 3 of *Neural Networks*
3. Sharpen up on math before going deeper into the *Mathematics for Machine Learning* book.
