# Jenny's Diary

## Feb. 18 2021

1. I watched the "3Blue1Brown" video giving a general overview of neural nets using a number classification example. Among other concepts, the video covered hidden layers and weights.
2. I also read through the first chapter of [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) by Victor Zhou which covered how to assign weights and basic training of a neural net model.


**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. I plan to read Chapter 1 of *Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction* and write out any questions I have

1. I read through chapter 1 of Rojas' *Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction* which went through the foundation and theory of Neural Networks.

**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. I plan to read Chapter 2 of *Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction* and write out any questions I have
2. I plan to watch the second video of 3Blue1Brown


## Feb. 25 2021

1. I watched 3Blue1Brown episodes 2-4. These videos covered Gradient descent, Backpropogation, and some of the calculus involved with Backpropogation. The calculus caused the most confusion for me. Mainly in relation to derivatives and the chain rule.
2. I read through chapter 2 of *Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction*.

**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. I plan to work through the example of a neural net that was provided as a resource with the 3Blue1Brown video.
