1. I watched the "3Blue1Brown" video giving a general overview of neural nets using a number classification example. Among other concepts, the video covered hidden layers and weights.
2. I also read through the first chapter of [Machine Learning for Beginners: An Introduction to Neural Networks](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/) by Victor Zhou which covered how to assign weights and basic training of a neural net model.


**To-Do For Next Time:**

1. I plan to read Chapter 1 of *Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction* and write out any questions I have

1. I read through chapter 1 of Rojas' *Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction* which went through the foundation and theory of Neural Networks.
